# audioviz
my own audio visualizer, because after effects sucks.
builds on windows and linux!!!!

here are some demos:

## building
### linux
1. install any required dependencies below
2. run `cmake -S. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` or use your IDE of choice with CMake support

### windows
1. create a directory called `windows_deps`, with three subdirectories `ffmpeg`, `portaudio`, and `fftw`
2. install ffmpeg in one of two ways:
  - run these commands in an **administrator** command prompt (`mklink` doesn't run otherwise), replace `[version]` with the ffmpeg version that was installed by winget:
    ```cmd
    winget install gyan.ffmpeg.shared
    mklink /D windows_deps\ffmpeg %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg.Shared_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-[version]-full_build-shared
    ```
	the `mklink` command simply links the winget installation directory to `windows_deps/ffmpeg`.
  - or, go [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds), download the "shared" release and extract the archive to `windows_deps/ffmpeg`
3. download [portaudio](https://files.portaudio.com/download.html) source, extract `portaudio.h` (inside `include` directory of the tarball) to `windows_deps/portaudio`. i recommending using 7zip for viewing archives: you can get it by running `winget install 7zip`.
4. download the [64bit portaudio dll](https://github.com/spatialaudio/portaudio-binaries), rename it to `portaudio_x64.dll`, and move it to `windows_deps/portaudio`
5. download [fftw](https://fftw.org/install/windows.html), open the archive and extract `fftw3.h` and `libfftw3f-3.dll` into `windows_deps/fftw`
6. **optionally**, create a `lua` directory in `windows_deps`, install lua with `winget install devcom.lua`, then in an an admin command prompt run:
  ```cmd
  mklink /D windows_deps\lua %LocalAppData%\Programs\Lua
  ```

## libraries/software used
- [FFTW](https://fftw.org)
- [libavpp](https://github.com/trustytrojan/libavpp)
  - requires the [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) libraries
- the `ffmpeg` CLI program, also part of the [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) project
  - required for video encoding
- [portaudio-pp](https://github.com/trustytrojan/portaudio-pp)
  - requires [PortAudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio) (only the C library)
- [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)
  - note that SFML only supports X11 windows, so you will need XWayland if you use Wayland
- [argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)
- [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2)
- [spline](https://github.com/ttk592/spline)

## dev note
on namespaces:
- `fx`: post-processing effects
- `tt`: utility & library extensions
- `viz`: audio visualization components

### environment setup
i recommend using vscode as it integrates well with git with no effort. get the [cmake tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) and [clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) to make development easier.

on windows please use the [mingw toolchain](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases) as it is the only toolchain i have compiled with, and honestly the easiest to setup and use. clangd might freak out about the standard headers being missing: to fix this, open clangd extension settings, and add the following argument:
```
--query-driver=C:\path\to\mingw\bin\g++.exe
```

## todo list
- ✅️ `viz::ScopeDrawable`
  - basically done, want extra feature: audio window customization independent of shape size
- lua api (in progress)
  - ✅️ modular layering/effects system
  - remove hardcoded visualizer components
- make `audioviz` generic, extend it with default functionality in a new class named `ttviz`
  - figure out how to deal with [`fft_size`](src/audioviz.cpp#L284) and [`sa.analyze(...)`](src/audioviz.cpp#L299)
- add components/effects based on rhythm
  - involves knowing the tempo of the song
  - want a small translucent flash overlay that flashes to the beat of music
  - copy the osu! stars effect
- need to experiment with only using the ffmpeg CLI instead of the libraries
  - ✅️ figure out metadata parsing, then subprocessing for the audio/video streams
  - ✅️ this *might* fix all the "ending early" problems (not a guarantee)
  - try using `basic_ipstream` over `basic_pipe`
  - try to have one `ffmpeg` process output both streams
- ⁉️ figure out why particles randomly don't show on linux
